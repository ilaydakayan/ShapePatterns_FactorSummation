# ShapePatterns_FactorSummation
This repository includes solutions for a Python programming exercise centered on mathematical computations and generating patterns. 

# Pattern Shape Generator

This Python program generates a pattern based on a user-specified odd number. The program only accepts odd numbers, and if an even number is entered, it prompts the user to enter an odd number. The program creates a square matrix with the specified size, where `X` and `#` characters are placed on the diagonals, and the rest of the cells are filled with `*`.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. You will be prompted to enter an odd number:
   - If you enter an odd number, the program generates the pattern.
   - If you enter an even number, you will be prompted again to enter an odd number.

## Example Outputs

### Example 1
Please enter an odd number: 5 
X * * * #
* X * # *
* * X * *
* # * X *
# * * * X





## Requirements

- Python 3.x is required to run this program.
